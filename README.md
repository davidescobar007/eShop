A basic ecommerce app, frontend and backend

In backend folder you will find the server, just run "npm run dev" to start the server, it was built with node js and express. 

In frontend folder you will find the react app, it was build with react hooks and context api for state management, it also comes with sass for styling, 

Do not forget to leave the comment on sections you think there coul be an improvment. 😀

Best 😁
